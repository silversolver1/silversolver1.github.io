image linking still doesn't work


i have not uploaded full day one notes yet 

in total, i opened android studio, learned how to turn the background on or off, learned how to show code/split/design.

learned that editing in the composables seems to make more sense than editing things in setContent (for some reason editing name doesn't work if done in setContent - not sure why)

did have a list of a few more questions

saw virtual device manager, so i should know how to get devices that can be used for virtual emulator

downloaded all sdk platforms and tools

it ran, which was nice

going to see if i can find a way to embed images

published my own blog post

learned how to put urls in markdown

nice
